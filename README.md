# 📝 Resume Ranker – My First Real-World Python Project

This is one of my first self-built Python projects where I tried to simulate a basic Applicant Tracking System (ATS).  
The tool checks how well a resume matches a job description using keyword matching and shows a match score.  
It helped me understand how job filtering systems work behind the scenes.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Takes resume and job description as text input  
- Extracts keywords from both using basic string logic  
- Calculates how many words match  
- Shows a percentage score and gives basic feedback

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, I wanted to build something meaningful while learning Python.  
Instead of just printing patterns or making calculators, I tried to build a mini tool that actually connects to the real world — job resumes and hiring.  
This was a step toward understanding how even small scripts can solve big problems.

## 🔍 What I Learned While Making It

- How to take multi-line input in Python  
- How to split and clean text  
- How to compare sets and calculate match percentage  
- How basic ATS systems might screen resumes

---

## 💻 How to Use

Just run the Python script in any IDE or terminal:

```bash
python resume_ranker.py
```

Paste your resume content and job description when prompted.  
It will show how well your resume fits that job based on keyword matching.
